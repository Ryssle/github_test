  <h1><b></b>RYSSLE</b></h1>
  <h4>Aspiring Rap Artist</h4>
  <p>At his younger age until now, he always loves to listen rap music. Because when he was a child, he always use to hear hiphop music because he grows on a place where you go outside your house, you will see a group of thugs having fun and plays loud music. And because of that, it captures his interest to listen more about that type of music. And at the age of 16, he started to cover rap songs and also learn how to write his own rap verses then starting on joining rap challenges on social media. And in this current year, one of the happiest things happened in his life when his favorite rapper Gloc-9 listens to his rap verses and reacted on that and also shared it on his own facebook page.</p>
