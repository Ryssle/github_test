  <h1><b></b>RYSSLE</b></h1>
  <h4>An Inspired Kiddo</h4>
  <p>He graduated on a public high school on 2020, but didn't pursue college because of financial problems. But back when he was studying, he was honored as one of the principals listers on his school. So you might say he is a studious person but unfortunately he ended up working as a production worker and a warehouseman in a logistics company.</p>
